# Project Topic - Build Model to predict whether a Loan will be charged off based on features available at loan origination. 

This topic was selected because I am employed by a $2.2 billion financial instituion in the area of credit risk management.  In addition to the utilitarian purpose of the model, I am observing artificial intellence emerging in lending.  IN my environment, non-learning models are in use today in predicting the probability of losses.  We have just implemented a learning model in the consumer loan origination process.  I desire a greater and deeper understanding of the logic behind a model's "decision making" and how and what it is learning.  

At a minimum, the model will consider the features available at the time of loan origination.  These features are obtained primarily from the loan applicant.  I am assessing whether I would be able to also consider environmental data, external to the applicant within the model. Examples of such data would be market interest rates, unemployment rate, or rental vacancy rate but would not be limited to these.
